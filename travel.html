            <p class="tra-intro">Monteverde, Costa Rica is situated 4,662 feet above sea level. Monteverde's famed cloud
                forests are the byproduct of fog (a thick, low-hanging cloud) tangling amongst the leaves and branches
                of the forest canopy. Trails and hanging bridges offer a close-up view of the diverse variety of animals
                and plants living in the forest.
                <br> One of the main tourist locations in Monteverde is the town of Santa Elena, which is not only home
                to a variety of restaurants with delicious food, but a serpentarium as well. You can enjoy hiking,
                ziplining, and observing the native wildlife while staying in Monteverde. It's a truly beautiful place.

                Bangkok welcomes more visitors than any other city in the world and it doesn't take long to realize why.
                Bangkok is a city of contrasts with action at every turn. Marvel at the gleaming temples, catch a tuk
                tuk through bustling Chinatown or take a longtail boat through floating markets. Food is another Bangkok
                highlight, from local dishes served at humble street stalls to haute cuisine at romantic rooftop
                restaurants.
