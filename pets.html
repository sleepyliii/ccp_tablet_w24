            <p class="pet-intro">Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the
                three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the
                neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the
                embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.
                <br>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of
                his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
            </P>
